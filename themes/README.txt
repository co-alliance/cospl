Place downloaded and custom themes that modify your site's appearance in this
directory to ensure clean separation from Colorado Alliance Core  and to facilitate safe,
self-contained code updates. Contributed themes from the Drupal community may
be downloaded at http://drupal.org/project/themes.

It is safe to organize themes into subdirectories and is recommended to use
Drupal's sub-theme functionality to ensure easy maintenance and upgrades.
