Place downloaded and custom modules that modify your site's functionality in this
directory to ensure clean separation from Colorado Alliance Core and to facilitate safe,
self-contained code updates. Contributed modules from the Drupal community may
be downloaded at http://drupal.org/project/modules.

It is safe to organize modules into subdirectories, such as "contrib" for
contributed modules, and "custom" for custom modules. Note that if you move a
module to a subdirectory after it has been enabled, you may need to clear the
Drupal cache so that it can be found.
